  The article addresses the current inefficiencies and financial risks consumers face due to the lack of a
comprehensive used car valuation and recommendation system. It proposes the development of an innovative
used car trading reference system that leverages advanced data mining analysis and visualization technology
to enhance the transparency and efficiency of vehicle valuation and recommendations for consumers. The
study reviews past methodologies, including the use of random forest, Hedonic Price Model (HPM), and
various machine learning techniques such as XGBoost and LightGBM for predicting used car prices. Among
these, random forest has been identified as the most accurate model.
  Despite the progress made, the research acknowledges the existing challenges in accurately capturing
market dynamics and handling unstructured data. The methodology involves acquiring data from online
marketplaces, followed by rigorous preprocessing and cleansing to ensure the data is suitable for analysis.
  The study undertakes a comparative analysis of different predictive models, ultimately finding the random
forest model to be the most accurate for used car price predictions.
The developed system is implemented using the Django framework, which provides a user-friendly
interface allowing users to input specific vehicle indicators and receive accurate price predictions. This
system aims to empower consumers with reliable information and recommendations, thereby minimizing
financial risks and enhancing the overall efficiency of the used car market.
