# Readme 
In this project,we mainly use the **random forest** after comparing with other model,which is include Linear Regression,Decision Tree,Adaboost, Gradient Boosting.
After compared with it's score,we choose the best one to be our project's main model.
The picture is the random forest's schematic diagram:
